Interface which allows users to effortlessly input the names of people they wish to track, along with their respective arrival times.
This is my first Python project.
The project utilizes I/O operations file writing in Python(writing to a .txt file, if not present creating one, if present, adding onto the already present .txt file)
Known bugs:
When prompted for the amount of users we wish to track(Multiple Entry Mode) giving 0 causes the program to crash.
