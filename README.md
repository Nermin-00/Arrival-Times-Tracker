# Arrival-Times-Tracker
Interface which allows users to effortlessly input the names of people they wish to track, along with their respective arrival times.
This is my first Python project.
The project utilizes I/O operations file writing in Python(writing to a .txt file, if not present creating one, if present, adding onto the already present .txt file)
Known bugs:
When prompted for the amount of users we wish to track(Multiple Entry Mode) giving 0 causes the program to crash.
